## Task 2

## Intructions

- Your goal is to animate the background color to change from white to black, then back to white ONCE in 6 seconds. After the background has finished animate the image in the "/images" folder to move around the screen infinitely in a zig zag pattern.

1. Start off by setting up the animation for the background using keyframes, make sure the animation only lasts 6 seconds

2. Add an <img> tag to the index.html file which should store the image that is already in the "/images" folder

3. Animate the image to go in an infinite zig zag pattern around the screen, make sure that this animation only happens once the previous is done :)
